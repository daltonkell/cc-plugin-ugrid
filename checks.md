### A (very) Brief Summary of UGRID Conventions
These tests are designed with respect to the [UGRID conventions](http://ugrid-conventions.github.io/ugrid-conventions/).

The UGRID conventions contain a variety of names for geometrical attributes, and the checks output results directly referencing these names. For 1D, 2D, or 3D datasets, the checks will iterate through a series of required attributes. A star (&bigstar;) indicates the convention is required, an o-dot (&odot;) represents optional attributes, and a checkmark (&check;) indicates that our code currently checks for the attribute.

### UGRID Plugin Checks

| Check | Summary |
| ----- | ------- |
| ```check_mesh_topology_variable``` | Checks to see if a mesh topology variable exists within the dataset |
| ```check_topology_dimension``` | Verifies the *topology_dimension* attribute is either 1, 2, or 3 |
| ```check_node_coordinates_size``` | Checks that the mesh's *node_coordinates* length is the same as the *topology_dimension* |
| ```check_node_coordinates_exist``` | *node_coordinates* values must be variables in the dataset |
| ```check_connectivity``` | Connectivity must exist between nodes in the dataset, whether the connections are node-node (1D), edge-node (2D), or face-node (3D) ||

### What's Next for the UGRID Checker?
As the UGRID Checker plugin is a child of IOOS, its development comes from a variety of open-source and commercial efforts. For an outline of features in development or to contribute to the UGRID Checker, check [here](/roadmap.md) for suggestions.
